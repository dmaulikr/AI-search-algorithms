Swift implementation of the Null Move Quiescence Search and Alpha-Beta Algorithms.

This app allows to create sample game trees using the parameters provided in order to compare the performance of two search algorithms: Null Move Quiescence Search and Alpha-Beta. For this purpose 10 trees with a branching factor of 5 and height of 10 were created. As expected, Null Move Quiescence Search algorithm delivers a better accuracy but requires a greater number of static evaluations.

The main logic of the game is in the file AI-Assignment-1/ViewController.swift

To run the project XCode 8 or greater is needed.
